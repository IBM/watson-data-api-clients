    You can use a collection of Watson Data REST APIs associated with Watson Studio and Watson Knowledge Catalog to manage data-related assets and connections in analytics projects and catalogs on IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

    Use the catalog and asset APIs to create catalogs to administer your assets, associate properties with those assets, and organize the users who use the assets. Assets can be notebooks or connections to files, database sources, or data assets from a connection.

    Use the governance and workflows APIs to implement data policies and a business glossary that fits to your organization to control user access rights to assets and to uncover data quality and data lineage.

    Use the discovery, search, and connections APIs to add and find data within your projects and catalogs.

        create a new COS bucket using generated unique name, all credentials, asset
        container and call all the required atomic APIs to fully configure a new project.
        Attempts to use the duplicate project names will result in an error. <b>NOTE</b>:  when

        <br/><br/><br/> This endpoint can also be used to create a project from an
        exported Watson Studio .zip file. In this case, a new transaction is initiated
        to create assets under the project. A Transaction ID along with a URL is returned
        as a response of this API. As this transaction can take time, you can view
        the current status of the transaction using the returned URL.<br><b>NOTE</b>:

      description: "Use this API to retrieve _metadata_ about a data asset. The response\
        \ document will contain three top-level fields:<br/>\n * **'metadata':** contains\
        \ metadata common to all types of assets\n * **'entity':** contains metadata\
        \ specific to the asset_type - in this case 'data_asset'\n * **'attachments':**\
        \ an array containing one item of metadata per attached resource<br/><br/>The\
        \ data described by the above metadata is stored in attached resources.  Examples\
        \ of attached resources are database tables, csv files, word documents, extended\
        \ metadata documents, etc.  Because an item in the 'attachments' array only\
        \ contains metadata about an attached resource, accessing the actual attached\
        \ resource requires additional server calls.  Exactly which additional server\
        \ calls are needed depends on the kind of attached resource.  Follow the steps\
        \ below to access an attached resource.<br/><br/>\n    **Step 1**: find the\
        \ index i of the item in the above 'attachments' array whose 'asset_type'\
        \ value matches the type of the attached resource you want to access.  For\
        \ a 'data_asset' attached resource look for the item i where 'attachments[i].asset_type'\
        \ is 'data_asset'.<br/><br/>There are two important pairs of fields (among\
        \ many others) which may appear in 'attachments[i]'.  Only one of those pairs\
        \ will actually appear.  Which pair appears influences which steps to perform\
        \ next.<br/>\n *  **Pair 1:** **'connection_id'** and **'connection_path'**:\n\
        \ \t* The above two fields will appear in 'attachments[i]' if the value of\
        \ 'attachments[i].is_remote' is true.\n \t* 'attachments[i].is_remote' WILL\
        \ be true if the attached resource is a database table.  In this case, 'attachments[i].connection_path'\
        \ will contain a schema name and table name.\n \t* 'attachments[i].is_remote'\
        \ MAY be true if the attached resource is, for example, a csv file.  In this\
        \ case, 'attachments[i].connection_path' will contain a folder path and file\
        \ name.<br/><br/>If the above pair of fields are present in 'attachments[i]'\
        \ then:<br/>\n    **Step 2**: use the value of the 'attachments[i].connection_id'\
        \ field to make a call to the **GET /v2/connections/{connection_id}** API.\
        \  You'll need appropriate credentials.<br/>\n    **Step 3**: use the values\
        \ in the 'entity.properties' field of the result from Step 2 to either create\
        \ a connection to the database containing the table or to retrieve the file.<br/><br/>Note:\
        \ even if 'attachments[i].is_remote' is true and the above pair of fields\
        \ are present in 'attachments[i]', if the attached resource is located in\
        \ the catalog/project bucket then you may optionally perform the two steps\
        \ discussed for Pair 2 ('object_key' and 'handle') below.<br/>\n * **Pair\
        \ 2:** **'object_key'** and **'handle'**:\n \t* The above two fields will\
        \ appear in 'attachments[i]' if the value of 'attachments[i].is_remote' is\
        \ false.  In this case, 'attachments[i].handle' will contain information about\
        \ the attached resource.<br/>\n    **Step 2**: use the value of the 'attachments[i].id'\
        \ field as the value for 'attachment_id' in a call to the **GET /v2/assets/{asset_id}/attachments/{attachment_id}**\
        \ API.  The value to use for 'asset_id' in the call to the attachments API\
        \ is the same as the value that was used for 'data_asset_id' in the original\
        \ call to the GET /v2/data_assets/{data_asset_id} API.<br/>\n    **Step 3**:\
        \ use the value in the 'url' field of the result from Step 2 to download (for\
        \ example, with a browser) a copy of the file."

    post:
      description: You can use this API to add folder assets to a catalog. Folder
        assets are similar to folders or directories in a file system.  In the same
        way that a directory in a file system can contain many files, a folder asset
        can represent groups of files or objects all sharing a common path. An example
        of a path may be '/sales_data/by_month/february'. There may be many different
        files with that common path, but we only need to register just the common
        path when we create a folder asset.<br/><br/>Along with other types of assets,
        such as data assets, folder assets share a common set of properties such as
        name, description, asset type, visibility, tags, classifications, etc. In
        addition to other types of assets, folder assets are denoted by a <b>'folder_asset'</b>
        json object within the common <b>'entity'</b> object. The folder_asset json
        object contains a <b>connection_id</b>, and a <b>connection_path</b>.<br/><br/>A
        folder asset can be mediated by a connection.  In other words, you can access
        the contents of the folder asset only through a connection in the connection
        service.  The connection can be to any external data store such as DashDB,
        Salesforce.com,IBM's Cloud Object Storage, etc.   You must specify the connection_id
        and the connection_path within the folder_asset json object. <br/><br/>Folder
        assets can also be local to the catalog or project, similar to local or referenced
        data attachments.  For such a folder asset you don't need the connection_id
        in the folder_asset json.  You only need to provide the connection_path. The
        API can use it's internal connection to IBM Cloud Object Storage to access
        that folder.<br/><br/>A connection path is like the path of a folder or a
        directory in a file system.  Using IBM Cloud Object Storage as an example,
        a connection_path for a folder object might be '/Bucket1/monthly_data_collection/March'.  Any
        objects falling under that path are part of the folder asset. This API cannot
        show you those files directly.  Instead, you can use your IBM Cloud Object
        Storage connection to traverse to that folder location and retrieve the files.

        |\"CONTAINS\", \"#-literal-\"|\"$-term-\" ] \n     -expression- \n      \n\
        where:\n- -term- is a technical term defined in the term glossary. \n- -literal-\
        \ is a literal.  For numerics a string representation of the number should\
        \ be specified.  For times, milliseconds are used (from Unix epoch).  For\
        \ boolean, #true and #false are used.\n\nThe definition of the operators in\
        \ a predicate:\n - EXISTS -- means that the term has a value of some kind.\
        \ \n - EQUALS -- evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal.\
        \ \n - LESS_THAN -- evaluates to true if the left is less in numeric value\
        \ than the right.\n - GREATER_THAN -- evaluates to true if the left is greater\
        \ in numeric value than the right.\n - CONTAINS -- is meant to test an array\
        \ term (such as Asset.Tags) with a single value.  It evaluates to true if\
        \ the value on the right side equals one of the values on the array on the\
        \ left side.  \nHowever it will also supports  a single value on the left,\
        \ in which case it behaves just like EQUALS -- regular expressions or wildcards\
        \ are not supported.\n \nFor all of the operators (except EXISTS), if the\
        \ right hand side evaluates to an array, each value of the array is compared\
        \ to the left side, according to the operator definition, and if any comparison\
        \ is true then the result of the evaluation is true.\n\nExamples: \n    \n\
        \     [[\"$Asset.Type\", \"EQUALS\", \"#Project\"]] \n     [\"NOT\", [\"$Asset.Tags\"\
        , \"CONTAINS\", \"#sensitive\"], \"AND\", [\"NOT\", \"$Asset.Tags\", \"CONTAINS\"\
        , \"#confidential\"]] \n     [[\"$User.Name\", \"EQUALS\", \"$Asset.Owner\"\
        ]] \n    \n<b>Action</b>\n \nThe action is an name with optional parameters\
        \ or subaction describing an operation to perform. \nFor simple actions like\
        \ Deny, only the action name will be provided.  For actions such as Transform,\
        \ a subaction with parameters describing the type of transform is also provided.\
        \ \nThe allowed actions depends on the governance type.  \n\nExamples: \n\n\
        \     {\"name\": \"Deny\"} \n     {\"name\": \"Transform\", \"subaction\"\
        : {\"name\": \"anonymizeColumns\", \"parameters\": [{\"name\": \"column_name\"\
        , \"value\": \"CCN\"}]}} \n \nThe maximum length allowed for 'name' parameter\
        \ is 80 characters, maximum length allowed for 'description' parameter: 1000\
        \ characters.\nAllowed characters for the 'name' parameter: letters from any\
        \ language, numbers in any script, space, dot, underscore, hyphen. Strings\
        \ with characters other than these are rejected (only for the name parameter)."

        query syntax, and your query may return an exception if the user input includes
        reserved Lucene tokens or symbols that are used incorrectly.  When the 'isSimple'
        parameter is set to true, Global Search will use a modified Lucene syntax
        as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;+ = AND operation<br>&nbsp;| = OR operation<br>&nbsp;-
        = NOT <br>&nbsp;" wraps a phrase<br>&nbsp;* is a wildcard (you can't use it
        at the beginning of a word but you can use it alone to signify match all)<br>&nbsp;(
        and ) evaluates tokens inside brackets with higher precedence<br><br>To use
        one of these characters literally, escape it with a preceding backslash.
